# Börsdata Integration Project Log

_Last updated: 2025-09-24 11:04 CEST_

## End Goal
Rebuild the data ingestion and processing pipeline so the application relies on Börsdata's REST API (per `README_Borsdata_API.md` and https://apidoc.borsdata.se/swagger/index.html). The system should let a user set a `BORSDATA_API_KEY` in `.env`, accept Börsdata-native tickers, and otherwise preserve the current user-facing workflows and capabilities.

## Current Focus
- Establish a clear migration path from the existing data sources to Börsdata endpoints.
- Identify all modules that fetch or rely on market data so we can scope the necessary changes.
- Ensure environment configuration (`.env`) cleanly injects the Börsdata API key and is picked up by affected components.

## Status Snapshot
- **Branch**: `borsdata` (active)
- **Working directory**: `/Users/ksu541/Code/ai-hedge-fund`
- **Latest actions**: Repository scanned; Börsdata documentation confirmed; tracking log updated with clarified scope; Swagger spec stored locally for offline reference; endpoint mapping drafted; Börsdata news coverage gap flagged for follow-up.

## Decision Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-09-24 | Treat `README_Borsdata_API.md` + Swagger docs as canonical API reference. | Aligns with user instruction to rebuild around those docs. | All integration work must match those specifications; cross-check endpoints before implementation. |
| 2025-09-24 | Maintain progress tracking in `PROJECT_LOG.md` at repo root. | Allows quick context reload after interruptions. | Update this file after each meaningful change (code or decisions). |
| 2025-09-24 | Retire legacy data sources in this branch; Börsdata becomes sole market data provider. | User clarified no legacy sources should remain. | Migration scope is the entire ingestion stack; no dual-source fallback required. |
| 2025-09-24 | Adapt/extend existing ingestion tests to validate Börsdata integration. | User confirmed tests should cover Börsdata usage. | Testing plan must include Börsdata fixtures/mocks and regression coverage for key workflows. |
| 2025-09-24 | Enforce Börsdata API rate limits (100 calls / 10 seconds; 429 on breach). | Documented in `README_Borsdata_API.md`; user emphasized need for limiting. | Implementation must incorporate request throttling or backoff respecting documented limits. |
| 2025-09-24 | Persist official Swagger spec under `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` for reference. | Avoids repeated network fetches and keeps canonical schema versioned with the migration work. | Parsing and validation can rely on the checked-in spec; update if Börsdata releases a new version. |
| 2025-09-24 | Replace company news feed with Börsdata calendar endpoints. | Börsdata lacks a news API; calendars supply time-sensitive company context without new vendors. | UI/backend should surface report + dividend calendars in place of the legacy news feature. |

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-24
- Kickoff: set up tracking log with end goal, current focus, and decision history.
- Surveyed repository structure and confirmed Börsdata README is present but untracked.
- Created dedicated `borsdata` branch from `main` to house migration work.
- Captured user's clarifications: Börsdata is sole source, tests must target Börsdata flows, rate limiting to follow official guidelines.
- Inventory in progress: identified `src/tools/api.py` as current FinancialDatasets wrapper with dependent components across backtesting and agents; reviewed cache usage and test fixtures tied to legacy API.
- Pulled official Swagger spec (`swagger.json`), extracted key endpoint details for instruments, stock prices, and KPI schemas; preliminary analysis indicates `InstrumentV1` provides Börsdata tickers and instrument IDs, `StockPriceV1` uses fields (`o`, `h`, `l`, `c`, `v`).
- Saved Swagger definition to `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` and created `docs/reference/borsdata_endpoint_mapping.md` outlining price, KPI, reports, and holdings endpoints plus identified gaps.
- Confirmed insider transactions available via `/v1/holdings/insider`; no Börsdata `/news` endpoint exists—needs alternative solution for news features.
- Documented KPI→FinancialMetrics mapping in `docs/reference/financial_metrics_borsdata_mapping.md` and `src/data/borsdata_metrics_mapping.py` for consistent runtime resolution.
- Authored `docs/borsdata_integration_plan.md` detailing client structure, rate limiting, and testing scope for the migration.
- Selected Börsdata report/dividend calendars as the replacement strategy for the news feed; pending UI wiring.
- Implemented `src/data/borsdata_client.py` with shared auth, rate limiting, and instrument caching; `get_prices` now pulls directly from Börsdata stock price endpoints.
- Added `FinancialMetricsAssembler` backed by KPI summaries + reports, extended the Börsdata client to expose metadata/screener/report helpers, and switched `get_financial_metrics` to the Börsdata pipeline with unit coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_kpis.py`.

## Next Actions
1. Swap line item searches to the Börsdata reports endpoint with local filtering.
2. Implement the calendar-based replacement for company news and update downstream consumers/UX text.
3. Update configuration to require `BORSDATA_API_KEY` and remove `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` usage.
4. Add Börsdata fixtures and tests covering rate limiting, KPI mapping (including screener history), price ingestion, and derived metrics.
5. Validate screener-driven FinancialMetrics fields against real Börsdata payloads and extend assembler fallbacks for alternative report types as needed.

## Open Questions
- What is the best way to persist resolved `kpiId` lookups (e.g., cached JSON vs in-memory) to limit metadata parsing?
- Do we need caching beyond rate limiting to manage quotas once endpoints and usage patterns are finalized?
