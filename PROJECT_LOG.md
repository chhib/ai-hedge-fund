# Börsdata Integration Project Log

_Last updated: 2025-09-25_

## End Goal
Rebuild the data ingestion and processing pipeline so the application relies on Börsdata's REST API (per `README_Borsdata_API.md` and https://apidoc.borsdata.se/swagger/index.html). The system should let a user set a `BORSDATA_API_KEY` in `.env`, accept Börsdata-native tickers, and otherwise preserve the current user-facing workflows and capabilities.

## Current Focus
- Establish a clear migration path from the existing data sources to Börsdata endpoints.
- Identify all modules that fetch or rely on market data so we can scope the necessary changes.
- Ensure environment configuration (`.env`) cleanly injects the Börsdata API key and is picked up by affected components.

## Status Snapshot
- **Branch**: `borsdata` (active)
- **Working directory**: `/Users/ksu541/Code/ai-hedge-fund`
- **Latest actions**: Börsdata calendars now backfill the company “news” flow, insider trades and config rely solely on Börsdata endpoints, and fixtures/docs/UI were refreshed to require `BORSDATA_API_KEY`; sandboxed pytest execution failed due to seatbelt kill; added targeted insider trade tests and verified pytest run with escalated permissions.

## Decision Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-09-24 | Treat `README_Borsdata_API.md` + Swagger docs as canonical API reference. | Aligns with user instruction to rebuild around those docs. | All integration work must match those specifications; cross-check endpoints before implementation. |
| 2025-09-24 | Maintain progress tracking in `PROJECT_LOG.md` at repo root. | Allows quick context reload after interruptions. | Update this file after each meaningful change (code or decisions). |
| 2025-09-24 | Retire legacy data sources in this branch; Börsdata becomes sole market data provider. | User clarified no legacy sources should remain. | Migration scope is the entire ingestion stack; no dual-source fallback required. |
| 2025-09-24 | Adapt/extend existing ingestion tests to validate Börsdata integration. | User confirmed tests should cover Börsdata usage. | Testing plan must include Börsdata fixtures/mocks and regression coverage for key workflows. |
| 2025-09-24 | Enforce Börsdata API rate limits (100 calls / 10 seconds; 429 on breach). | Documented in `README_Borsdata_API.md`; user emphasized need for limiting. | Implementation must incorporate request throttling or backoff respecting documented limits. |
| 2025-09-24 | Persist official Swagger spec under `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` for reference. | Avoids repeated network fetches and keeps canonical schema versioned with the migration work. | Parsing and validation can rely on the checked-in spec; update if Börsdata releases a new version. |
| 2025-09-24 | Replace company news feed with Börsdata calendar endpoints. | Börsdata lacks a news API; calendars supply time-sensitive company context without new vendors. | UI/backend should surface report + dividend calendars in place of the legacy news feature. |

## Progress Log
### Session 1
- Kickoff: set up tracking log with end goal, current focus, and decision history.
- Surveyed repository structure and confirmed Börsdata README is present but untracked.
- Created dedicated `borsdata` branch from `main` to house migration work.
- Captured user's clarifications: Börsdata is sole source, tests must target Börsdata flows, rate limiting to follow official guidelines.
- Inventory in progress: identified `src/tools/api.py` as current FinancialDatasets wrapper with dependent components across backtesting and agents; reviewed cache usage and test fixtures tied to legacy API.
- Pulled official Swagger spec (`swagger.json`), extracted key endpoint details for instruments, stock prices, and KPI schemas; preliminary analysis indicates `InstrumentV1` provides Börsdata tickers and instrument IDs, `StockPriceV1` uses fields (`o`, `h`, `l`, `c`, `v`).
- Saved Swagger definition to `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` and created `docs/reference/borsdata_endpoint_mapping.md` outlining price, KPI, reports, and holdings endpoints plus identified gaps.
- Confirmed insider transactions available via `/v1/holdings/insider`; no Börsdata `/news` endpoint exists—needs alternative solution for news features.
- Documented KPI→FinancialMetrics mapping in `docs/reference/financial_metrics_borsdata_mapping.md` and `src/data/borsdata_metrics_mapping.py` for consistent runtime resolution.
- Authored `docs/borsdata_integration_plan.md` detailing client structure, rate limiting, and testing scope for the migration.
- Selected Börsdata report/dividend calendars as the replacement strategy for the news feed; pending UI wiring.
- Implemented `src/data/borsdata_client.py` with shared auth, rate limiting, and instrument caching; `get_prices` now pulls directly from Börsdata stock price endpoints.
- Added `FinancialMetricsAssembler` backed by KPI summaries + reports, extended the Börsdata client to expose metadata/screener/report helpers, and switched `get_financial_metrics` to the Börsdata pipeline with unit coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_kpis.py`.
- Replaced the legacy line item search with `LineItemAssembler` leveraging Börsdata reports + KPI metadata, introduced shared helpers in `src/data/borsdata_common.py`, and added regression coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_reports.py`.

### Session 2
- Refactored company news models/cache into `CompanyEvent` calendar entries and updated agents, backtesting flows, and sentiment logic to reason over report/dividend catalysts.
- Extended `BorsdataClient` with calendar and insider holdings helpers; `get_company_events`, `get_insider_trades`, and `get_market_cap` now source exclusively from Börsdata endpoints.
- Purged `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` across runtime, docs, and frontend settings so only `BORSDATA_API_KEY` is accepted; updated fixtures to reflect Börsdata payload shapes.
- Attempted `pytest tests/backtesting/integration -q`; run was killed by macOS seatbelt, so new calendar/insider changes remain unverified by automated tests.

### Session 3
- Added `tests/test_company_calendar.py` to cover Börsdata report/dividend transformations, cache usage, and date filtering for `get_company_events`.
- Ran `poetry run pytest tests/test_company_calendar.py -q` outside the sandbox; suite passed confirming calendar coverage while leaving insider scenarios outstanding.
- Replaced MSFT fixtures/tests with Swedish Lundin Gold (`LUG`) data to keep Börsdata alignment and reran targeted pytest selection outside the sandbox (30 tests passing).
- Normalised test tickers to `TTWO` (international), `LUG` (Swedish), and `FDEV` (UK), including fixture renames, and revalidated the focused backtesting + calendar suites.

### Session 4
- Updated testing coverage with `tests/test_insider_trades.py` to validate Börsdata insider holdings transformation, filtering, and cache writes.
- Confirmed cached insider trade payloads bypass API calls via mock-backed regression.
- Ran `poetry run pytest tests/test_insider_trades.py -q` outside the sandbox (2 passed) after seatbelt kill in restricted mode.

### Session 5
- Regenerated Börsdata fixtures for `TTWO`, `FDEV`, and `LUG` covering 2025-09-15 through 2025-09-23 and removed superseded 2024 fixture JSON.
- Updated backtesting integration suites to the new date window and reran long-only, long-short, and short-only pytest targets (all passing).
- Noted new fixtures currently lack calendar/insider events for some tickers; plan to augment when Börsdata publishes next filings.
- Flagged that the LLM agent may benefit from clearing its context window to avoid degraded performance during extended sessions.

### Session 6
- Enriched Börsdata calendar fixtures for `TTWO`, `LUG`, and `FDEV` with multi-currency dividend events and recent report releases to reflect the new "corporate events" feed.
- Expanded insider trade fixtures with diverse buy/sell scenarios, board detection signals, and filing date fallbacks to cover conversion edge cases.
- Injected screener-derived growth metrics into the financial metrics fixtures to support upcoming validation of KPI fallbacks.
- Replaced the legacy rate-limiting tests with a BörsdataClient-focused suite that exercises Retry-After handling and token bucket waits; `pytest tests/test_api_rate_limiting.py tests/test_insider_trades.py tests/test_company_calendar.py -q` now passes locally.

### Session 7
- Backtest engine now captures Börsdata corporate events and insider trades per trading day, exposes them via `get_daily_context`, and prints a "Market Context" section in the CLI output.
- Updated integration tests to assert corporate events and insider trade data propagate end-to-end using the new Börsdata fixtures, and refreshed output builder tests for the context-aware display hook.

### Session 8
- Added period-aware screener fallbacks in `FinancialMetricsAssembler` so quarterly requests recurse to Börsdata's `calcGroup=quarter` metrics before defaulting to annual values.
- Extended the metric mapping with screener overrides and introduced unit coverage confirming quarterly growth figures populate when annual screener data is absent.

### Session 9
- Renamed the Börsdata calendar helpers to `get_company_events`, updated caches, agents, backtesting flows, and tests to drop lingering "news" terminology, and refreshed docs to describe the calendar-first model.
- Extended `BacktestService` to persist prefetched calendar/insider data, emit per-day `market_context`, and stream those snapshots (plus raw day results) to the frontend; added matching schema and TypeScript updates so UI work can consume the new payload.
- Verified calendar glazing with `poetry run pytest tests/test_company_calendar.py -q` (2 tests passing).

### Session 10
- Wired the backtest output tab to surface Börsdata market context: live stream cards now render the latest company events and insider trades, and completed runs show a timeline summarising the ten most recent snapshots.
- Added lightweight formatters for event amounts / insider activity and reused the shared snapshot type across new components to avoid additional backend coupling.
- Attempted `npm run lint` inside `app/frontend/`; command fails due to longstanding lint debt (unused variables in `Flow.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, numerous `no-explicit-any` warnings, mixed whitespace). New components compile but inherit the global lint failure state.

### Session 11
- Established a phased delivery plan: Phase 1 locks on the CLI backtest experience with Börsdata data flows, while Phase 2 (frontend streaming UI) remains parked until the command-line workflow is production-ready.
- Logged the shift so follow-up work prioritises CLI polish, output parity, and regression coverage before resuming browser UI enhancements.

### Session 12
- Added CLI display regressions for the Börsdata market context: new `tests/backtesting/test_results.py` cases confirm `print_backtest_results` surfaces corporate events / insider trades and hides the section when context is empty.
- Executed `poetry run pytest tests/backtesting/test_results.py -q` to validate the expanded coverage (passes with existing Pydantic deprecation warnings).

### Session 13
- Captured an SPY price fixture so benchmark calculations run from Börsdata JSON alongside TTWO/LUG/FDEV samples.
- Added `scripts/run_fixture_backtest.py` to patch Börsdata calls to the local fixtures and exercise the CLI loop with the configurable agent.
- Ran `poetry run python scripts/run_fixture_backtest.py` to stream the loop end-to-end; Sharpe settled at 4.23 and the SPY benchmark printed +1.48% while market context cards rendered as expected.

### Session 14 (handoff)
- Reviewed docs for accuracy; updated `docs/borsdata_integration_plan.md` to point to the live Börsdata fixture directory under `tests/fixtures/api/`.
- Verified the fixture-backed CLI harness (`scripts/run_fixture_backtest.py`) stays in sync with the integration suite patches, using the same loaders from `tests/backtesting/integration/conftest.py`.
- Notes for next agent: start with `poetry run python scripts/run_fixture_backtest.py` to sanity-check context streaming + benchmark math, then fold the harness into pytest as outlined in the Next Actions list.

### Session 15 (Phase 1 completion)
- Executed `scripts/run_fixture_backtest.py` to validate current Börsdata integration state; confirmed CLI output shows portfolio summary, market context (corporate events + insider trades), and benchmark calculations.
- Extended CLI integration tests with `test_cli_output_ordering_and_benchmark_validation` in `tests/backtesting/integration/test_integration_long_only.py` to validate output structure, ordering, and benchmark formatting.
- Created comprehensive CLI regression test suite in `tests/backtesting/integration/test_cli_regression.py` that promotes the fixture-driven harness to automated testing with 4 regression tests covering full workflow, benchmark calculations, market context content, and performance metrics consistency.
- All CLI regression tests pass (`poetry run pytest tests/backtesting/integration/test_cli_regression.py -v`), confirming Phase 1 CLI milestone is complete.

### Session 16 (Bug fixes)
- Fixed critical TypeError in Warren Buffett agent's `calculate_intrinsic_value` function at line 546: when calculating historical growth rate `((latest_earnings / oldest_earnings) ** (1 / years)) - 1`, negative earnings values were causing Python to return complex numbers, leading to comparison errors with float literals.
- Updated condition from `if oldest_earnings > 0:` to `if oldest_earnings > 0 and latest_earnings > 0:` to prevent complex number calculations when either earnings value is negative.
- Created comprehensive test coverage validating the fix handles negative earnings scenarios correctly: positive earnings, negative latest earnings, negative oldest earnings, and both negative earnings cases.
- Bug was triggered during UNIBAP ticker analysis when Warren Buffett agent attempted intrinsic value calculation with negative earnings data.

## Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
**CLI backtest experience with Börsdata data flows is production-ready.** The system successfully:
- Ingests price, financial metrics, corporate events, and insider trades from Börsdata fixtures
- Displays formatted CLI output with portfolio summaries, trading tables, and market context
- Calculates and displays benchmark returns (SPY) alongside portfolio performance
- Provides comprehensive test coverage for regression validation

## Next Actions
1. **Phase 2 preparation**: Review frontend lint debt and streaming UI components once Phase 1 deployment is confirmed.
2. **Production readiness**: Consider migrating from fixture data to live Börsdata API calls in staging environment.
3. **Performance optimization**: Monitor CLI output performance and consider context window management for extended agent sessions.

## Open Questions
- What is the best way to persist resolved `kpiId` lookups (e.g., cached JSON vs in-memory) to limit metadata parsing?
- Do we need caching beyond rate limiting to manage quotas once endpoints and usage patterns are finalized?
- Should we periodically clear the LLM agent's context window to maintain efficient reasoning over long sessions?

**IMPORTANT**: Update this log at the end of each work session: note completed steps, new decisions, blockers, and refreshed next actions. Always use session numbers (Session X, Session X+1, etc.) for progress entries. Update the "Last updated" date at the top with the actual current date when making changes.
