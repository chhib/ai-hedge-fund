# Börsdata Integration Project Log

_Last updated: 2025-09-24 15:20 CEST_

## End Goal
Rebuild the data ingestion and processing pipeline so the application relies on Börsdata's REST API (per `README_Borsdata_API.md` and https://apidoc.borsdata.se/swagger/index.html). The system should let a user set a `BORSDATA_API_KEY` in `.env`, accept Börsdata-native tickers, and otherwise preserve the current user-facing workflows and capabilities.

## Current Focus
- Establish a clear migration path from the existing data sources to Börsdata endpoints.
- Identify all modules that fetch or rely on market data so we can scope the necessary changes.
- Ensure environment configuration (`.env`) cleanly injects the Börsdata API key and is picked up by affected components.

## Status Snapshot
- **Branch**: `borsdata` (active)
- **Working directory**: `/Users/ksu541/Code/ai-hedge-fund`
- **Latest actions**: Börsdata calendars now backfill the company “news” flow, insider trades and config rely solely on Börsdata endpoints, and fixtures/docs/UI were refreshed to require `BORSDATA_API_KEY`; sandboxed pytest execution failed due to seatbelt kill.

## Decision Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-09-24 | Treat `README_Borsdata_API.md` + Swagger docs as canonical API reference. | Aligns with user instruction to rebuild around those docs. | All integration work must match those specifications; cross-check endpoints before implementation. |
| 2025-09-24 | Maintain progress tracking in `PROJECT_LOG.md` at repo root. | Allows quick context reload after interruptions. | Update this file after each meaningful change (code or decisions). |
| 2025-09-24 | Retire legacy data sources in this branch; Börsdata becomes sole market data provider. | User clarified no legacy sources should remain. | Migration scope is the entire ingestion stack; no dual-source fallback required. |
| 2025-09-24 | Adapt/extend existing ingestion tests to validate Börsdata integration. | User confirmed tests should cover Börsdata usage. | Testing plan must include Börsdata fixtures/mocks and regression coverage for key workflows. |
| 2025-09-24 | Enforce Börsdata API rate limits (100 calls / 10 seconds; 429 on breach). | Documented in `README_Borsdata_API.md`; user emphasized need for limiting. | Implementation must incorporate request throttling or backoff respecting documented limits. |
| 2025-09-24 | Persist official Swagger spec under `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` for reference. | Avoids repeated network fetches and keeps canonical schema versioned with the migration work. | Parsing and validation can rely on the checked-in spec; update if Börsdata releases a new version. |
| 2025-09-24 | Replace company news feed with Börsdata calendar endpoints. | Börsdata lacks a news API; calendars supply time-sensitive company context without new vendors. | UI/backend should surface report + dividend calendars in place of the legacy news feature. |

## Progress Log
### 2025-09-24
- Kickoff: set up tracking log with end goal, current focus, and decision history.
- Surveyed repository structure and confirmed Börsdata README is present but untracked.
- Created dedicated `borsdata` branch from `main` to house migration work.
- Captured user's clarifications: Börsdata is sole source, tests must target Börsdata flows, rate limiting to follow official guidelines.
- Inventory in progress: identified `src/tools/api.py` as current FinancialDatasets wrapper with dependent components across backtesting and agents; reviewed cache usage and test fixtures tied to legacy API.
- Pulled official Swagger spec (`swagger.json`), extracted key endpoint details for instruments, stock prices, and KPI schemas; preliminary analysis indicates `InstrumentV1` provides Börsdata tickers and instrument IDs, `StockPriceV1` uses fields (`o`, `h`, `l`, `c`, `v`).
- Saved Swagger definition to `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` and created `docs/reference/borsdata_endpoint_mapping.md` outlining price, KPI, reports, and holdings endpoints plus identified gaps.
- Confirmed insider transactions available via `/v1/holdings/insider`; no Börsdata `/news` endpoint exists—needs alternative solution for news features.
- Documented KPI→FinancialMetrics mapping in `docs/reference/financial_metrics_borsdata_mapping.md` and `src/data/borsdata_metrics_mapping.py` for consistent runtime resolution.
- Authored `docs/borsdata_integration_plan.md` detailing client structure, rate limiting, and testing scope for the migration.
- Selected Börsdata report/dividend calendars as the replacement strategy for the news feed; pending UI wiring.
- Implemented `src/data/borsdata_client.py` with shared auth, rate limiting, and instrument caching; `get_prices` now pulls directly from Börsdata stock price endpoints.
- Added `FinancialMetricsAssembler` backed by KPI summaries + reports, extended the Börsdata client to expose metadata/screener/report helpers, and switched `get_financial_metrics` to the Börsdata pipeline with unit coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_kpis.py`.
- Replaced the legacy line item search with `LineItemAssembler` leveraging Börsdata reports + KPI metadata, introduced shared helpers in `src/data/borsdata_common.py`, and added regression coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_reports.py`.

### 2025-09-24 (afternoon)
- Refactored company news models/cache into `CompanyEvent` calendar entries and updated agents, backtesting flows, and sentiment logic to reason over report/dividend catalysts.
- Extended `BorsdataClient` with calendar and insider holdings helpers; `get_company_news`, `get_insider_trades`, and `get_market_cap` now source exclusively from Börsdata endpoints.
- Purged `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` across runtime, docs, and frontend settings so only `BORSDATA_API_KEY` is accepted; updated fixtures to reflect Börsdata payload shapes.
- Attempted `pytest tests/backtesting/integration -q`; run was killed by macOS seatbelt, so new calendar/insider changes remain unverified by automated tests.

## Next Actions
1. Restore automated coverage for the new calendar + insider flows (update integration/unit tests and rerun pytest outside restrictive sandbox).
2. Expand Börsdata fixtures to exercise rate limiting, screener history, and insider edge cases (transaction types, missing dates, currency variants).
3. Validate screener-driven FinancialMetrics fields against live Börsdata payloads and add fallbacks for non-standard report types.
4. Review UI/UX messaging to ensure “news” references are updated to calendar terminology across CLI, backend responses, and frontend components.

## Open Questions
- What is the best way to persist resolved `kpiId` lookups (e.g., cached JSON vs in-memory) to limit metadata parsing?
- Do we need caching beyond rate limiting to manage quotas once endpoints and usage patterns are finalized?
