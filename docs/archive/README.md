# Archive - Historical Migration Documents

This directory contains historical documentation from the FinancialDatasets → Börsdata migration process. These documents are preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Migration History Documents

### [FD_BD_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md](FD_BD_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md)
**Purpose**: Cross-platform validation between original FinancialDatasets and Börsdata implementations

**Key Findings**:
- Börsdata provides 15-17% more metrics (81 vs 69-70)
- Identified critical scale mismatch (market caps in millions vs absolute values)
- Documented valuation ratio discrepancies (~28% differences)
- Provided harmonization recommendations

**Status**: Migration complete - differences documented and addressed

### [CURRENCY_HARMONIZATION_PLAN.md](CURRENCY_HARMONIZATION_PLAN.md)
**Purpose**: Strategy for handling multi-currency support (USD, SEK, DKK, NOK)

**Key Content**:
- Currency coverage analysis (FinancialDatasets: USD only vs Börsdata: 4 currencies)
- Normalization strategies for cross-currency comparisons
- Exchange rate integration plan
- Market cap scaling + currency conversion requirements

**Status**: Currency handling implemented in `ExchangeRateService`

### [borsdata_financial_metrics_mapping_analysis.md](borsdata_financial_metrics_mapping_analysis.md)
**Purpose**: Detailed KPI coverage analysis during initial Börsdata integration

**Key Content**:
- Analysis of available Börsdata KPIs vs existing FinancialMetrics model
- Coverage gaps identification
- Historical data availability (10-year periods)
- Holdings and alternative data sources

**Status**: Superseded by current metrics mapping documentation in `docs/borsdata/`

## Timeline

- **Session 30** (Sept 2024): FinancialDatasets/Börsdata cross-validation framework
- **Session 31** (Sept 2024): Jim Simons agent integration + currency conversion
- **Session 43** (Oct 2024): Multi-currency portfolio manager with GBX normalization

## Current State

The Börsdata migration is **100% complete**:
- ✅ All agents migrated to Börsdata
- ✅ Multi-currency support implemented
- ✅ 89 KPI mappings established
- ✅ Performance optimizations applied (95% API call reduction)
- ✅ LLM response caching with 7-day freshness
- ✅ Portfolio manager with currency detection

For current Börsdata documentation, see [docs/borsdata/](../borsdata/)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Scale Matters**: Always check if API returns values in millions vs absolute
2. **Currency is Complex**: Multi-currency support requires more than just exchange rates (GBX/GBP normalization, etc.)
3. **Data Source Differences**: Even "equivalent" metrics can differ 25-30% between providers due to calculation methodologies
4. **Migration Validation**: Cross-platform testing is essential to ensure investment decision integrity

These documents remain valuable for understanding the technical debt paid and design decisions made during the migration.
