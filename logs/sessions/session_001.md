# Sessions 1-10

## Session 1
- Kickoff: set up tracking log with end goal, current focus, and decision history.
- Surveyed repository structure and confirmed Börsdata README is present but untracked.
- Created dedicated `borsdata` branch from `main` to house migration work.
- Captured user's clarifications: Börsdata is sole source, tests must target Börsdata flows, rate limiting to follow official guidelines.
- Inventory in progress: identified `src/tools/api.py` as current FinancialDatasets wrapper with dependent components across backtesting and agents; reviewed cache usage and test fixtures tied to legacy API.
- Pulled official Swagger spec (`swagger.json`), extracted key endpoint details for instruments, stock prices, and KPI schemas; preliminary analysis indicates `InstrumentV1` provides Börsdata tickers and instrument IDs, `StockPriceV1` uses fields (`o`, `h`, `l`, `c`, `v`).
- Saved Swagger definition to `docs/reference/swagger_v1.json` and created `docs/reference/borsdata_endpoint_mapping.md` outlining price, KPI, reports, and holdings endpoints plus identified gaps.
- Confirmed insider transactions available via `/v1/holdings/insider`; no Börsdata `/news` endpoint exists—needs alternative solution for news features.
- Documented KPI→FinancialMetrics mapping in `docs/reference/financial_metrics_borsdata_mapping.md` and `src/data/borsdata_metrics_mapping.py` for consistent runtime resolution.
- Authored `docs/borsdata_integration_plan.md` detailing client structure, rate limiting, and testing scope for the migration.
- Selected Börsdata report/dividend calendars as the replacement strategy for the news feed; pending UI wiring.
- Implemented `src/data/borsdata_client.py` with shared auth, rate limiting, and instrument caching; `get_prices` now pulls directly from Börsdata stock price endpoints.
- Added `FinancialMetricsAssembler` backed by KPI summaries + reports, extended the Börsdata client to expose metadata/screener/report helpers, and switched `get_financial_metrics` to the Börsdata pipeline with unit coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_kpis.py`.
- Replaced the legacy line item search with `LineItemAssembler` leveraging Börsdata reports + KPI metadata, introduced shared helpers in `src/data/borsdata_common.py`, and added regression coverage in `tests/data/test_borsdata_reports.py`.

## Session 2
- Refactored company news models/cache into `CompanyEvent` calendar entries and updated agents, backtesting flows, and sentiment logic to reason over report/dividend catalysts.
- Extended `BorsdataClient` with calendar and insider holdings helpers; `get_company_events`, `get_insider_trades`, and `get_market_cap` now source exclusively from Börsdata endpoints.
- Purged `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` across runtime, docs, and frontend settings so only `BORSDATA_API_KEY` is accepted; updated fixtures to reflect Börsdata payload shapes.
- Attempted `pytest tests/backtesting/integration -q`; run was killed by macOS seatbelt, so new calendar/insider changes remain unverified by automated tests.

## Session 3
- Added `tests/test_company_calendar.py` to cover Börsdata report/dividend transformations, cache usage, and date filtering for `get_company_events`.
- Ran `poetry run pytest tests/test_company_calendar.py -q` outside the sandbox; suite passed confirming calendar coverage while leaving insider scenarios outstanding.
- Replaced MSFT fixtures/tests with Swedish Lundin Gold (`LUG`) data to keep Börsdata alignment and reran targeted pytest selection outside the sandbox (30 tests passing).
- Normalised test tickers to `TTWO` (international), `LUG` (Swedish), and `FDEV` (UK), including fixture renames, and revalidated the focused backtesting + calendar suites.

## Session 4
- Updated testing coverage with `tests/test_insider_trades.py` to validate Börsdata insider holdings transformation, filtering, and cache writes.
- Confirmed cached insider trade payloads bypass API calls via mock-backed regression.
- Ran `poetry run pytest tests/test_insider_trades.py -q` outside the sandbox (2 passed) after seatbelt kill in restricted mode.

## Session 5
- Regenerated Börsdata fixtures for `TTWO`, `FDEV`, and `LUG` covering 2025-09-15 through 2025-09-23 and removed superseded 2024 fixture JSON.
- Updated backtesting integration suites to the new date window and reran long-only, long-short, and short-only pytest targets (all passing).
- Noted new fixtures currently lack calendar/insider events for some tickers; plan to augment when Börsdata publishes next filings.
- Flagged that the LLM agent may benefit from clearing its context window to avoid degraded performance during extended sessions.

## Session 6
- Enriched Börsdata calendar fixtures for `TTWO`, `LUG`, and `FDEV` with multi-currency dividend events and recent report releases to reflect the new "corporate events" feed.
- Expanded insider trade fixtures with diverse buy/sell scenarios, board detection signals, and filing date fallbacks to cover conversion edge cases.
- Injected screener-derived growth metrics into the financial metrics fixtures to support upcoming validation of KPI fallbacks.
- Replaced the legacy rate-limiting tests with a BörsdataClient-focused suite that exercises Retry-After handling and token bucket waits; `pytest tests/test_api_rate_limiting.py tests/test_insider_trades.py tests/test_company_calendar.py -q` now passes locally.

## Session 7
- Backtest engine now captures Börsdata corporate events and insider trades per trading day, exposes them via `get_daily_context`, and prints a "Market Context" section in the CLI output.
- Updated integration tests to assert corporate events and insider trade data propagate end-to-end using the new Börsdata fixtures, and refreshed output builder tests for the context-aware display hook.

## Session 8
- Added period-aware screener fallbacks in `FinancialMetricsAssembler` so quarterly requests recurse to Börsdata's `calcGroup=quarter` metrics before defaulting to annual values.
- Extended the metric mapping with screener overrides and introduced unit coverage confirming quarterly growth figures populate when annual screener data is absent.

## Session 9
- Renamed the Börsdata calendar helpers to `get_company_events`, updated caches, agents, backtesting flows, and tests to drop lingering "news" terminology, and refreshed docs to describe the calendar-first model.
- Extended `BacktestService` to persist prefetched calendar/insider data, emit per-day `market_context`, and stream those snapshots (plus raw day results) to the frontend; added matching schema and TypeScript updates so UI work can consume the new payload.
- Verified calendar glazing with `poetry run pytest tests/test_company_calendar.py -q` (2 tests passing).

## Session 10
- Wired the backtest output tab to surface Börsdata market context: live stream cards now render the latest company events and insider trades, and completed runs show a timeline summarising the ten most recent snapshots.
- Added lightweight formatters for event amounts / insider activity and reused the shared snapshot type across new components to avoid additional backend coupling.
- Attempted `npm run lint` inside `app/frontend/`; command fails due to longstanding lint debt (unused variables in `Flow.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, numerous `no-explicit-any` warnings, mixed whitespace). New components compile but inherit the global lint failure state.
