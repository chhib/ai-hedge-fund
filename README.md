# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

## üöß System Overview

**This is an enhanced AI hedge fund system with comprehensive market data integration.**

- **Command-line interface**: ‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Full CLI experience with B√∂rsdata data integration for Nordic/European and Global markets
- **Web interface**: ‚úÖ **Operational** - Full-stack web application with streaming UI components and B√∂rsdata integration

The system provides both command-line and web interfaces with comprehensive market analysis capabilities.

This system employs several agents working together:

### Core Analysis Agents
- **Fundamentals Analyst** - Evaluates company health through financial thresholds (ROE, margins, growth metrics)
- **Technical Analyst** - Combines 5 strategies: trend following, mean reversion, momentum, volatility, statistical arbitrage
- **Sentiment Analyst** - Analyzes insider trades and corporate events to gauge market sentiment
- **Valuation Analyst** - Calculates intrinsic value using DCF, Owner Earnings, EV/EBITDA, and Residual Income models
- **Risk Manager** - Sets position limits based on volatility and correlation analysis

### Legendary Investor Agents
- **Warren Buffett** - Value investing with 30% margin of safety using conservative DCF
- **Ben Graham** - Father of value investing, Graham Number and net-net analysis
- **Charlie Munger** - Quality businesses with economic moats and predictable earnings
- **Peter Lynch** - Growth at reasonable price (PEG ratio) with "ten-bagger" potential
- **Phil Fisher** - Growth investing through "scuttlebutt" research and R&D analysis
- **Bill Ackman** - Activist investing targeting operational improvement opportunities
- **Cathie Wood** - Disruptive innovation focus with aggressive growth assumptions
- **Michael Burry** - Contrarian deep value with high free cash flow yields
- **Mohnish Pabrai** - "Heads I win, tails I don't lose much" with downside protection
- **Stanley Druckenmiller** - Macro momentum with growth and risk/reward analysis
- **Rakesh Jhunjhunwala** - High-quality growth with ROE > 20% requirements
- **Aswath Damodaran** - Academic valuation using CAPM and sophisticated DCF models

### Portfolio Management
- **Portfolio Manager** - Aggregates all signals and makes final trading decisions within risk limits

For detailed strategy implementations and thresholds, see [Trading Agent Strategies](docs/trading_agent_strategies.md).

## How to Install

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you'll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chhib/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Set up API keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Open and edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
BORSDATA_API_KEY=your-borsdata-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

**Financial Data**: All B√∂rsdata endpoints require the `BORSDATA_API_KEY`. Set this value in your `.env` file before running the application.

## How to Run

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface

You can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

#### Quick Start

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

#### Run the AI Hedge Fund

The system supports both Nordic/European and global company analysis:

**Nordic/European companies** (via B√∂rsdata Nordic instruments):
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --tickers ERIC.ST,VOLV-B.ST,ADVT
```

**Global companies** (via B√∂rsdata Global instruments):
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --tickers-global AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Quick test mode** (uses gpt-5 with fundamentals, technical, and sentiment analysts):
```bash
# Test with Nordic company
poetry run python src/main.py --tickers ADVT --test

# Test with global company
poetry run python src/main.py --tickers-global AAPL --test
```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --tickers-global AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --tickers-global AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

#### Run the Backtester

**Nordic/European companies:**
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --tickers ERIC.ST,VOLV-B.ST,ADVT
```

**Global companies:**
```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --tickers-global AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**

Note: The `--ollama`, `--start-date`, and `--end-date` flags work for the backtester, as well!

### üñ•Ô∏è Web Application

The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. This is recommended for users who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.

Please see detailed instructions on how to install and run the web application [here](https://github.com/chhib/ai-hedge-fund/tree/main/app).
